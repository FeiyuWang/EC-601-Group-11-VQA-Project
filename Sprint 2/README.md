# Dataset

The dataset used in VQA model is VQA2.0.

Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2.0 is a dataset containing open-ended questions about images. These questions require an understanding of vision, language and commonsense knowledge to answer. It is the second version of the VQA dataset[1].

* 265,016 images (COCO and abstract scenes)
* At least 3 questions (5.4 questions on average) per image
* 10 ground truth answers per question
* 3 plausible (but likely incorrect) answers per question
* Automatic evaluation metric

The most commonly used dataset is VQA2.0

# Model

The model uded in VQA is MMF, MoViE+MCAN model. The MMF uses the same based technologies - Bottom up and top down to analysis imagines and respones with answers by the question raised.[3]

To set the environment, follow the following steps from [4].
* download data
* install dependencies
* Install MMF
* Install maskrcnn-benchmark
* Demo
